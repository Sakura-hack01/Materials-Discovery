# Materials Discovery


## Project Overview

The project presents an end-to-end machine learning and active learning framework for materials discovery. The system integrates robust data preprocessing, feature engineering, predictive modelling, uncertainity quantification, and Bayesian Optimization along with active learning to accelerate the identification of promising materials with desired properties.

## Dataset Description

This datatset contains structured data designed to train, evaluate, and validate machine learning models for predictive analytics. Key features of the dataset are :-

• Name :- name of matrials

• Formula :- Molecular formula of materials.

• Spacegroup :- space group of crystal structure, which defines its symmetry properties based on International Tables for Crystallography.

• nelements :- number of distinct elements in compund.

• n_sites :- total  number of atomic sites in crystal's unit cell (inclding repeated atoms due to symmetry).
